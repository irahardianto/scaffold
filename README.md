# Gemini Scaffold

This repository contains the advanced configuration and skill definitions for the **Gemini CLI** agent. It transforms the agent into a **Precision Software Engineer** capable of planning complex architectures and executing them with surgical accuracy using a Test-Driven Development (TDD) workflow.

## 🚀 Overview

The scaffold operates on a strict **Plan → Execute** cycle, governed by a "Technical Constitution" that enforces high-quality, testable, and secure code.

### The Workflow

1.  **Plan**: The agent analyzes requirements, researches necessary technologies, and generates a detailed implementation plan. This plan is composed of atomic, bite-sized tasks (2-5 mins each) designed for TDD.
2.  **Execute**: The agent reads the plan and implements it in controlled batches. It strictly adheres to existing patterns, verifies every step with tests, and maintains a "memory" of the project state.

## 🧠 Capabilities & Skills

This scaffold equips the agent with specialized "skills" located in `.gemini/skills/`:

### 1. Technical Constitution (`technical-constitution`)
**The Supreme Law.** A comprehensive set of engineering principles that the agent *must* follow. It dictates:
*   **Testability-First Architecture**: Code must be testable in isolation.
*   **SOLID Principles**: Strict adherence to software design best practices.
*   **Security**: OWASP Top 10 compliance, input validation, and safe logging.
*   **Error Handling**: No silent failures; explicit, structured error handling.

### 2. Frontend Design (`frontend-design`)
A specialized module for generating distinctive, production-grade UIs. It steers the agent away from generic "AI" designs towards bold, intentional aesthetics with focus on typography, motion, and spatial composition.

### 3. Sequential Thinking (`sequential-thinking`)
A cognitive tool that allows the agent to break down complex problems, self-correct, and branch its reasoning. It is used automatically when the agent faces ambiguity or difficult debugging scenarios.

### 4. Knowledge Searching (`knowledge-searching`)
A protocol for fetching implementation details. The agent is strictly forbidden from "guessing" library APIs; it must use RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to find exact syntax and patterns before coding.

## 🛠️ Commands

### `plan`
Analyzes requirements and creates a TDD implementation plan.

*   **Role**: Technical Specification Engineer.
*   **Input**: A feature request, bug report, or PRD.
*   **Process**:
    1.  Analyzes the codebase architecture.
    2.  Extracts requirements (nouns/verbs).
    3.  Performs RAG searches for unknown technologies.
    4.  Generates a Markdown plan in `docs/plans/` with exact file paths and test cases.
*   **Usage**: `plan "Implement user authentication using JWT"`

### `execute`
Executes an existing plan with surgical precision.

*   **Role**: Precision Code Engineer.
*   **Input**: A plan file generated by the `plan` command.
*   **Process**:
    1.  **Pattern Discovery**: Scans the codebase to match existing styles (80% consistency rule).
    2.  **Batch Execution**: Implements tasks in small batches (default: 3).
    3.  **Verification**: Runs tests after *every* task.
    4.  **Memory Update**: Updates project knowledge after completion.
*   **Usage**: `execute "docs/plans/2023-12-23-user-auth-01.md"`

## 📋 Prerequisites

To utilize this scaffold, you must have:

1.  **Gemini CLI**: The core agent runner.
2.  **Serena**: The toolset enabling symbol-based code navigation and manipulation. The agent relies on Serena to "see" and "touch" the code precisely.
3.  **Archon** (Recommended): For managing long-running tasks and knowledge.

## 🏁 Getting Started

1.  **Initialize**: Ensure this repository is the root of your workspace.
2.  **Activate**: Start your Gemini session. The agent will automatically load the commands and skills.
3.  **Plan a Feature**:
    ```bash
    gemini> plan "Create a new API endpoint for listing products with pagination"
    ```
4.  **Review**: Check the generated plan in `docs/plans/`.
5.  **Execute**:
    ```bash
    gemini> execute "docs/plans/2025-01-01-products-api-01.md"
    ```
